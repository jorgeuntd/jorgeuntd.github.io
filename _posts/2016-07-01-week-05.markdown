# updates after the midterm ðŸ˜„

hi there everyone!

this *past week* was very **intense** since we had our *midterms anticipated*, but now we're back on track and i am very happy for having my **final project** *all set*. the professor is majorly giving us the *last couple of tutorials* on how to use some **machines** for the ones who are going to use them. i don't think i will, but i'm going just for *curiosity*, i like to know all the resources that we have available, and also there's a chance that brett give us any *important advice* or **announcement**, so i don't want to miss.
i talked to brett yesterday and he helped me to finish my *list of materials* and now i know exactly what i'm going to *need* and have to **buy**. i'm gonna order everything as soon as possible to receive them in time and also start looking for how to write the *code* i am going to need.

best regards,
