# going through week 02 :grin:

on this **second week** of the research we started learning more **technical stuff**. we had a class to teach us how to use the *resources* that iit provides us, and we also learned a lot of **rhinoceros** and **grasshopper** basic stuff. i am still a little *confused* about these tools, since i never used them, and never saw anyone using them, but i'll figure it out.
we were also encouraged to develop a **100 x 100 mm wood box** by designing it with our computers and then using the *laser cutters* at iit to build them. something like this:

![Example of Wood Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgeuntd/jorgeuntd.github.io/master/images/wood_box.jpg)

i'll probably use **autocad** to design them since i'm already very accostumed to its language, and *brett* showed us how to use the *laser cutters* with it.

when i went to show brett my idea for the final project, he showed me a *project developed by one of his students in the past* where the girl designed a **robot** that *followed the light like a sunflower*. he also told me to think about it more **creatively**. that made me *rethink* my idea. and while thinking about it, and also thinking about some of the examples that brett showed us in the beggining of our encounters, i thought about something very *different* from what i has originally thought. i was trying to *relate humans to buildings and their everyday lives*, and i also thought about a video that brett showed us where a *robot talked with people when they interacted with it*. so i thought about *putting a motion sensor in a trash can*, in a way that *they know when someone throws something inside the hole of the trash*. so then, the trash could say something like *"BUCKET!"*. or if the person misses it, the trash can could say like *"oh man! it's ok, u can try again."*
i think this is an **interesting idea** because it makes an *everyday thing* looks more *humanlike*, while also integrating some **humor**.

i hope this idea can work better, :blush:
