# hi there everyone!

so, this week was **good** because i started to take a look on *how am i going to actually put my project in practice*. and while looking for **tutorials** for the pieces i am going to use a lot of **questions** started to appear in my head that i'll have to ask the professor when we meet.

1. i looked for a lot of **basic stuff** on *separate pieces*. i looked at the **photon 101 page** and looked at some [examples](http://bit.ly/29fAXYt) of codes to try to *understand better its language* and *start thinking on how was i going to code my idea*. and my major question now is *how am i going to code with my photon since it is connected to my professor's network*.

2. i also went back to the [halloween scream box diy](http://bit.ly/1YqcAaI) since it is the *most close i could get to what i want to do*. but the diy connects only a soundboard to a motion sensor and a little speaker. and the connections are different, so *i'm not sure how am i going to do*. i'll have to ask brett about this too.

3. also, all i know by now is *random examples of the pieces alone*. i'm not sure yet **how the code is going to connect them all**. that's another question too, and the one which is *worrying me the most*. i'll probably have to connect the photon with the sound board and the speaker and the switcher. i'll talk to brett so that he *explain me which is the easiest way*.

as soon as i have all this figured out we'll get in touch again,

see you all,
