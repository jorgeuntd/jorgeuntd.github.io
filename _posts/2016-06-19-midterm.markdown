# finalizing the idea for the final project ðŸ˜„

this *last week* was pretty **intense**. we had our **midterm** anticipated, so we had to *decide* and *finish* our *concept* for the **final project**. we were asked to do *three things*:

1. we made a little [abstract](http://bit.ly/1sNdfqp) to the future paper we are going to **write** about our research.

2. also we had to present a [schedule](http://bit.ly/1sNcXA7) to **organize** what we are going to do in the days to come.

3. and finally a [presentation](http://bit.ly/1tDrQpj) to **explain** to our friends and professor in class what was our concept and how it could work.

happily the professor liked my final idea, and i also think it is very *interesting*.

i hope it all work out fine. â˜º
